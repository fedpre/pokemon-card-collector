# üéÆ Pokemon Card Collector

A React Native mobile application that allows users to browse Pokemon cards and collect their favorites in a personal Pokedex.

## üì± App Purpose

Pokemon Card Collector is a mobile application that:

- Displays Pokemon cards from the PokeAPI
- Allows users to browse through available Pokemon
- Enables users to add favorite Pokemon to their personal Pokedex collection
- Provides a clean, intuitive interface for Pokemon enthusiasts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **React Navigation**: For screen navigation with bottom tabs
- **React Query**: For efficient API data fetching and caching
- **Zustand**: For lightweight state management
- **React Native Reanimated**: For smooth animations
- **React Native Skia**: For high-performance graphics
- **PokeAPI**: External API for Pokemon data

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.
To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

#### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## üîç Full-scale Production Considerations

As this is a demonstration project, here are key considerations for scaling to production:

- **Branding & Design**:

  - Custom app icon and splash screen
  - Consistent typography and design system
  - Polished UI animations and transitions

- **Performance & Reliability**:

  - Implement error boundaries and fallback UIs
  - Optimize image loading and caching
  - Add comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)

- **User Experience**:

  - Add search and filtering capabilities
  - Implement offline mode with data persistence
  - Add haptic feedback for interactions

- **Analytics & Monitoring**:

  - Implement analytics to track user behavior and engagement
  - Add crash reporting and performance monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)
  - Set up remote logging for production debugging

- **Data Management**:

  - Local persistence with SQLite (via libraries like Drizzle)
  - Cloud synchronization options
  - Efficient state management for complex data flows

- **Authentication & Security**:

  - User authentication (Firebase, Supabase, or custom)
  - Secure storage for user data
  - API request throttling and security measures

- **Deployment & CI/CD**:
  - Automated build and release pipeline
  - Version management and feature flags
  - App store optimization for discoverability
